Using computer vision on football clips.

This was made for an one-off small freelancing project, in which I got scammed and didn't get paid. So, it's not a pleasant memory. There's no reason I'd continue development on this, so I'll be archiving this repo. You're welcome to use the code or fork it, shoot me an email for anything else.
